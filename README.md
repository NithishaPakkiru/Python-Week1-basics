Beginner Python Project Using Jupyter Notebook
This project was created as part of my Week 1 Python learning journey.
I learned Python fundamentals including variables, input/output, strings, lists, and basic logic.
The project is a Personal Introduction Program that interacts with the user and displays a friendly welcome message.
The project was developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda.
